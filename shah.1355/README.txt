/*This README assumes that you have installed java and set your path environment variables up so that they can run java commands*/
Steps to compile/run:

1. Download and unzip assignment

2. Open cmd and change directory to where unzipped assignment is stored

3. Use "javac filename.java" to compile program. You must compile all the .java files. 
These programs can be found in the src folder of the specific assignment. I.e., use the compilation command for 
"Sudoku.java", "HillClimb.java", and "TestHarness.java"

4. Run using "java TestHarness testFile" where testfile = name of Test file
Any other run method will fail. For example, to run  with the given test file,
you would type: "java TestHarness PATH\data\baseTest.txt" where PATH is the specific
path to where students lab3 submission was unzipped.

5. Repeat step 4 for all tests. The specific test files can be found in the data folder.
